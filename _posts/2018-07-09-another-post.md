I was part of something special. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Must go faster. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist?

Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Jaguar shark!

God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck.
